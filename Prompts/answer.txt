1. Scraping method: Are we targeting RSS feeds. For example - https://weworkremotely.com/remote-jobs.rss
2. Scope of filters: Keyword matching should check everything Title, Snippet, Company/Location etc.
3. The Active column in Sources and Filters tab is a checkbox. If the checkbox is checked, it means Active.
4. Scoring model: It is purely additive i.e. the sum of keyword weights. Let's keep it simple for now.
5. Notifications: The digest email should be a html table. Format the email to be in html and have a table with the relevant columns.
6. Frequency: We'll create triggers to run the script. However, we'll also create a menu item in the sheet to run the script on demand as well.
7. Status values: We'll have these values - New, Notified, Applied, Interviewing, Rejected, Ignore. By default, the status will be New. However, based upon the score, we can set it as Ignore as well. Upon successful notification, we can change the status to Notified.
8. Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling including try/catch blocks and graceful exits upon failed fetching. Include logs and notifications as well.
9. Auth and anti-bot issues - You'll suggest the best approach for this.
10. Ensure we don't notify for the same job twice.
11. Ensure the code is optimized for performance.

I hope this clarifies things. Don't generate any code yet until I explicitly tell you, because I have special instructions regarding how I want the code generated.

Ask for any other clarifications if you have any. If you have no further questions, ask me for the coding instructions.
